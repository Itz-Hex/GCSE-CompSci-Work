# GCSE Computer Science - Python Programming Repository

Welcome to my repository containing all my Python programming work for my GCSE Computer Science course. This repository is organized by topics or assignments, with each folder containing individual programs or collections of files related to that topic or project.

## Structure

The repository is divided into folders by topic or assignment. Each folder may contain:
- **Multiple individual programs**: Simple scripts with filenames indicating their purpose or the assignment they are part of.
- **Larger projects**: Collections of files or subfolders that make up a larger program. These projects will usually have a `main.py` file that can be run to execute the full project.

### Folder Example:
```plaintext
📁 Algorithms
    ├── linear_search.py
    ├── binary_search.py
📁 ObjectOrientedProgramming
    ├── class_example.py
    ├── inheritance_demo.py
📁 Project_Name
    ├── main.py
    ├── module1.py
    ├── module2.py
```

## How to Run

The project can be run in two ways, locally (requires python 3.12 to be installed, and any associated libraries) or online.

### Locally

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Itz-Hex/GCSE-CompSci-Work.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd foldername
   ```
3. For individual scripts, run them directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python scriptname.py
   ```
4. For larger projects, navigate to the project folder and run the main.py file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
Note: Some later versions of python/methods of installation may work better if you use the ``py`` command as opposed to ``python`` to run the scripts, so if you are experiencing any issues with running the scripts, try that.

### Online (Codespaces)

1. Ensure you have the repository cloned on GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository page on GitHub.
3. Click the green Code button and select Open with Codespaces.
4. If you don't have a Codespace yet, create a new one for this repository.
5. Once the environment loads, navigate to the folder of the project you want to run.
6. Open the terminal in Codespaces and use the following commands to run the code:
   ```bash
   cd foldername
   ```
   ```bash
   python scriptname.py
   ```
7. For larger projects:
```bash
cd Project_Name
```
```bash
python main.py
```

This will allow you to run and test your code directly in the browser without needing a local environment (e.g. when on a chromebook). If you have any issues with this, send me an email and I'll do my best to help.



## Topics Covered

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for my GCSE Computer Science coursework, but feel free to explore and learn from the code. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
